# Lead Qualification Framework

## Lead Scoring Criteria

Our lead qualification system uses a point-based scoring model to prioritize sales opportunities. Leads are scored across three dimensions:

### Company Size

- Enterprise (1000+ employees): 30 points
- Mid-market (100-999 employees): 20 points
- Small business (10-99 employees): 10 points
- Micro business (<10 employees): 5 points

### Engagement Level

- Attended demo or product presentation: 25 points
- Downloaded whitepaper or case study: 15 points
- Visited pricing page: 20 points
- Engaged with email campaign (3+ clicks): 10 points
- Social media interaction: 5 points

### Deal Size Potential

- Annual contract value (ACV) > $100K: 30 points
- ACV $50K-$100K: 20 points
- ACV $25K-$50K: 15 points
- ACV $10K-$25K: 10 points
- ACV < $10K: 5 points

## Lead Prioritization

**Hot Leads (70+ points)**
- Immediate sales follow-up required within 24 hours
- Assign to senior account executive
- Schedule executive briefing if ACV > $100K

**Warm Leads (40-69 points)**
- Follow-up within 3 business days
- Nurture with targeted content
- Qualify for product fit and timing

**Cold Leads (<40 points)**
- Add to nurture campaign
- Monthly check-in via marketing automation
- Re-score quarterly based on engagement

## Best Practices

- Update lead scores weekly based on new interactions
- Sales reps should add manual points for verbal interest indicators
- Review scoring model quarterly and adjust weights based on conversion data
- Always verify contact information before major outreach efforts

## Disqualification Criteria

Immediately disqualify leads that:
- Are students or academic researchers (unless enterprise university deal)
- Are competitors gathering intelligence
- Have no budget authority and no sponsor
- Are in industries we don't serve

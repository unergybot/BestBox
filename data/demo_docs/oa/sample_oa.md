# Meeting Scheduling Guidelines

## Scheduling Best Practices

### Meeting Duration Standards

Choose appropriate meeting lengths based on purpose:

- **Quick sync or standup**: 15 minutes
- **Status update or checkpoint**: 30 minutes
- **Problem-solving discussion**: 45 minutes
- **Planning or brainstorming session**: 60 minutes
- **Strategic planning or workshop**: 90-120 minutes

**Important**: Always end meetings 5 minutes early to allow buffer time between back-to-back meetings (e.g., schedule 25 or 55 minutes instead of 30 or 60).

### Required Attendees vs. Optional

Clearly designate attendee roles:

**Required Attendees:**
- Decision makers for the topic at hand
- Subject matter experts who will present or provide key input
- Anyone whose approval or sign-off is needed

**Optional Attendees:**
- Those who benefit from the information but aren't critical to decisions
- Team members who are "nice to have" for context
- Stakeholders who may delegate attendance

**Rule**: Never have more than 8 required attendees. If more people need to be involved, consider:
- Breaking into multiple focused sessions
- Recording the meeting for async viewing
- Sending detailed notes instead

### Meeting Invitations

All meeting invitations must include:

1. **Clear, descriptive title** (not just "Sync" or "Discussion")
2. **Detailed agenda** with time allocations
3. **Meeting objective** (what decision or outcome is expected)
4. **Pre-read materials** (attached or linked)
5. **Virtual meeting link** (even if hybrid)
6. **Any preparation required** from attendees

Send invitations:
- At least 3 business days in advance for normal meetings
- At least 1 week in advance for meetings requiring preparation
- At least 2 weeks in advance for executive or board meetings

## Rescheduling Policy

### Acceptable Reasons to Reschedule

- Key decision maker has a conflict
- More than 40% of required attendees unavailable
- Critical pre-requisite work isn't completed
- Higher priority business emergency

### Rescheduling Process

1. **Check availability** of all required attendees before proposing new time
2. **Provide 24 hours notice** minimum (except true emergencies)
3. **Explain reason** for reschedule in updated invitation
4. **Propose specific alternative times** (don't just cancel)

### Recurring Meeting Exceptions

For standing meetings (weekly syncs, monthly reviews):
- Cancel if primary organizer is unavailable
- Proceed with alternate facilitator if >50% of team can attend
- Consider async update via email/Slack for low-priority recurring syncs

## Calendar Management Best Practices

### Protecting Focus Time

- Block 2-hour focus time slots daily for deep work
- Mark focus time blocks as "Do Not Schedule" or "Busy"
- Decline meetings during focus time unless executive-level urgent

### Meeting-Free Days

Teams are encouraged to designate meeting-free days:
- Engineering teams: "No Meeting Wednesdays"
- Individual contributors: Choose one day per week for focused work

### Respecting Time Zones

For distributed teams:
- Rotate meeting times to share timezone burden
- Avoid scheduling before 9 AM or after 5 PM in any attendee's timezone
- Use world clock tools to check timezone-appropriate times
- Record meetings for those who can't attend live

## Virtual Meeting Etiquette

- **Join on time** (not 5 minutes late)
- **Video on** for meetings <8 people
- **Mute when not speaking** in larger meetings
- **Use "raise hand"** feature instead of interrupting
- **Test tech 5 minutes early** for presentations
- **Share slides in advance** when possible

## Meeting Notes and Follow-up

- Designate note-taker at start of meeting
- Use standardized template with: Attendees, Decisions, Action Items, Next Steps
- Share notes within 24 hours
- Track action items in project management tool
- Set due dates for all action items
